      all numbers are written in base twelve (dozonal), the word "dozen" is used when the number "twelve in base ten" would be needed. A complete system would need a way to write ten and eleven as single character digits but that isn't relevant to this document.

    <p>
      so 10=dozen, 0.6 = 6/dozen = half of 1, etc.

      This proposes a unit "scoops" denoted "sc" here as a unit of volume defined as 1/dozen of an imperial cup. all the following conversions are given:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>1 cup = a dozen scoops = 10sc</li>
      <li>1/2 cup = 6sc</li>
      <li>1/3 cup = 4sc</li>
      <li>1/4 cup = 3sc</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon + 1 teaspoon = 1sc</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon = 0.9sc (9/dozen)</li>
      <li>1/2 tablespoon = 0.46sc</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon = 0.3sc</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon = 0.09sc</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      All measurements currently in my kitchen can be represented with a single digit or a digit followed by 6 (half of the next digit) with this scoops unit. When scaling recipes it is often easier to convert to this system then convert back since a recipe that calls for 2 tablespoons (0.9sc*2=1.6sc) that is being quadrupled (1.6sc*4=6sc) can use a half cup measure instead of counting out 8 tablespoons.

      I don't necessarily expect this to be useful to anyone else as you have to already be somewhat familiar with quick calculations in dozonal but since I've also looked at clock displays using dozonal I already have some experience
