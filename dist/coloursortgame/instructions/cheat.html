  <h1>Colour Sort Instructions Cheat Button</h1>
  <p>
    The <strong>cheat</strong> button can be used to check states for you. It's notion of <em class="airquote">depth</em> is a little different from <em class="airquote">moves</em>, if a state only has one possible move it will follow forced options until reaching a state with options, even if all but one of them is known to be dead. 
  </p>
  <p>
    The first time you click the cheat button from a game state it
    checks each <em class="airquote">child state</em> (the game
    state you get to after performing a move) If a child state only
    has one viable move it checks the state after that move and if
    that also only has one move it checks that and so on. The result
    is that on the first click of <strong>cheat</strong> button if a
    move leads to a totally forced sequence of moves that leads to a
    dead state it marks that move as dead, which you can see by
    using <strong>cheat</strong> from the initial state in this
    level, or after making one move of <span class="Ball A"><span>A</span></span>.
  </p>
  <p>
    After the first use of <strong>cheat</strong> subsequent uses analyse new states, all states at the next <em class="airquote">depth</em> (corresponding to <em class="airquote">choices</em> which is every move from a state with more than one valid move). It informs you how many states it visited which can help identify dead ends, if the number keeps dropping to 0 then it is likely a complicated dead end, but if it grows rapidly then there is probably a state down the line that frees up an empty tube.
