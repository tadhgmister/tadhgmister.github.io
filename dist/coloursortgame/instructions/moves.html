  <p>
    When blocks can be moved to a partially filled tube, it is highlighted. When there is no partially filled tube to match, 
    any colour can move to an empty tube, if you have one.
  </p>
  <p>
    After you make the first move, try undoing to see the borders! A double line around a tube indicates that move goes to a state you have already visited. In this case since all the tubes are the same each initial move is equivelent, but in normal games the double border is a good way to identify what you have already tried.
  </p>
  <p>
    If a move would lead to a dead end it is given a red border, try clicking on it to see what a deadend looks like! Undo or reset is always an option.
